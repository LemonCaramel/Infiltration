Introduction
--------
- Since a while ago, South Korea has a problem of failing to access the authentication server. ([WEB-6504](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/WEB-6504))
 This mod reduces the probability of a problem by [changing the host](https://www.koreaminecraft.net/free/3489955) and making multiple requests to the authentication server.
